## 1. The State of the Sector: A Profile of the 2026 Expo Attendee

A deep understanding of the target audience—their professional backgrounds, core motivations, and purchasing power—is fundamental to designing a compelling event. This section synthesises survey data to create a detailed profile of the modern forensics professional, providing the empirical foundation for the strategic recommendations that follow.

### 1.1 A Diverse and International Audience

The survey data reveals a professionally diverse and geographically widespread audience. The top three organisational affiliations are Forensic Service Providers (21.31%), Academic/Research Institutions (13.11%), and Private Sector Organisations (13.11%). This composition necessitates a carefully balanced content program that addresses the distinct needs of front-line practitioners, commercial innovators, and the research community. Critically, the event has a significant international footprint, with a majority of respondents (57.38%) operating internationally. This global contingent far outweighs any single UK region, including the leading domestic areas of London (13.11%) and the South East (11.48%). The strategic implication is clear: the Expo must cater to a blended audience of public, private, and academic professionals with a strong international outlook.

### 1.2 Core Attendee Motivations and Content Priorities

Analysis of attendee motivations reveals a clear focus on professional growth and knowledge acquisition. The primary drivers for event attendance are tangible career and operational benefits.

- **Technical Knowledge and Innovation:** Learning about new forensic techniques and technologies is the leading motivation, cited by 59.57% of respondents.
- **Sector Challenges:** Staying current with sector-wide challenges and developments is a key priority for 44.68%.
- **Sector Awareness:** Staying current with sector-wide challenges and developments is a key priority for 55.32%.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Nearly half of the audience (46.81%) is motivated by the opportunity to learn about new forensic techniques and technologies.

These motivations are directly reflected in content preferences. When asked which content streams appeal most, the audience interest spans all three proposed streams:
- Scenes of Crime emerges as the dominant content demand (63.83% interest)
- Laboratory Sciences follows at 55.32%
- Mobile & Data Forensics commands 46.81% interest

When asked to identify their single main area of professional specialization:
- Mobile, Digital & Data Forensics leads at32.56%
- Scenes of Crime and Evidence Collection follows at27.91%
- Laboratory Sciences represents23.26%

This dual data perspective reveals that while many professionals specialize in digital forensics, they also require strong foundational content across all forensic practices. The event must therefore balance cutting-edge digital content with robust coverage of established forensic methodologies.

### 1.3 Significant Purchasing Influence and Budgetary Control

The commercial value of the Expo's audience is confirmed by their direct and substantial involvement in procurement. Attendees are not passive observers; they are deeply embedded in purchasing cycle. When asked about procurement roles, 15.00% conduct research, 30.00% recommend and specify, and 27.50% hold final decision-making authority. Additionally, 47.50% actively source forensic products and solutions.

This influence is matched by significant budgetary control. A majority (55%) of respondents influence annual budgets over £20,000, with 25% influencing budgets in the £20,000 to £100,000 range and 15% influencing budgets of £100,000 to £250,000. This profile defines the Expo attendee as a highly engaged, technically focused, and commercially influential professional, making them a prime audience for industry suppliers and solution providers.

## 2. Five Strategic Pillars for a Successful 2026 Expo

The following section translates the preceding audience analysis into five actionable strategic pillars. These pillars form the foundational blueprint for the event's content, marketing, and commercial strategy, ensuring it directly meets the identified needs of the forensics community.

### Pillar 1: Content Primacy—Align with the Digital Transformation Wave

Given the audience's content preferences, the Expo should balance coverage across all three primary streams. Scenes of Crime (63.83% interest) and Laboratory Sciences (55.32% interest) are dominant content demands, while Mobile & Data Forensics (46.81%) remains critical as the primary specialization for 32.56% of professionals. It is imperative that organisers allocate premium speaking slots, interactive demonstrations, and a significant portion of the marketing focus to this topic. By meeting this demand head-on, the Expo will not only capture its target audience but also solidify its brand as the essential annual forum for the digital transformation of forensics.

### Pillar 2: Audience Strategy—Cultivate a Diverse Global Community

We recommend a targeted marketing and content strategy that explicitly addresses the key audience segments: public forensic service providers, private sector organisations, and the academic community. Crucially, the event must leverage its strong international appeal, evidenced by the 57.38% of respondents operating globally. This should involve forming international partnerships, curating content that addresses global forensic challenges, and promoting the Expo as a premier international gathering. This inclusive approach will broaden the event's reach and reinforce its global standing.

### Pillar 3: Value Proposition—Anchor the Expo in Professional Development and Innovation

The event's core value proposition must be built around the top attendee motivations: CPD, networking, and insight into sector challenges. Organisers should prominently feature CPD accreditation opportunities across the conference programme. Furthermore, dedicated networking formats, such as round-table discussions and themed receptions, should be designed to facilitate the meaningful peer-to-peer collaboration that 40.43% of attendees seek. Additionally, 59.57% of attendees prioritize learning about new forensic techniques and technologies. A clear focus on these intrinsic needs will be a powerful driver for registrations and delegate satisfaction.

### Pillar 4: Commercial Focus—Leverage Audience Purchasing Power to Attract Exhibitors

The commercial sales strategy must pivot to lead with the high value and purchasing influence of the Expo audience. The data provides a compelling, evidence-based narrative for potential exhibitors, which should be communicated through two key points:

- **Direct Access to Buyers:** Exhibitors will engage with an audience where over half influence budgets exceeding £20,000. These are not passive observers; they are actively involved in procurement research (47.50% actively source products, 15.00% conduct research) and product specification (30.00% recommend and specify, 27.50% as Decision Makers).
- **Alignment with Procurement Needs:** Attendee purchasing interests are a direct match for key exhibitor categories. Top areas for procurement include Digital forensics software & hardware (20.00%) and Scenes of Crime equipment (17.50%), ensuring a strong alignment between supply and demand.

This data-driven approach will empower the sales team to articulate a clear return on investment and secure high-value exhibitors.

### Pillar 5: Attendee Experience—Optimise Event Format and Duration

Survey data on attendance duration shows a split preference, with a slight lead for single-day attendance (44.68%) over a two-day commitment (38.30%). To cater to both segments, the Expo should be designed with a "modular" schedule. This approach would feature a high-impact, single-day ticket option focused on keynotes and core content, complemented by a comprehensive two-day experience for those seeking deeper engagement. This flexibility respects attendees' time constraints and is likely to maximise the total number of participants.

## 3. Conclusion: A Data-Driven Blueprint for Success

The survey data provides a clear mandate for the strategic direction of Forensics Europe Expo 2026. By focusing on the five strategic pillars—Digital Content Primacy, Global Audience Cultivation, a Value Proposition rooted in Professional Development, a sharp Commercial Focus, and a Flexible Attendee Experience—the organisers can deliver a highly successful event. This data-driven blueprint will ensure the Expo meets the evolving needs of the modern forensics sector, delivering exceptional value to attendees and exhibitors alike.
